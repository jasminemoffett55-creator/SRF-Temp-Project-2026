#Lesson goals:

#0. Load packages - packages of the specific languages you want
#1. Open a cleaned dataset - have github read in data, tell it what to name files -clean names- and where they live
#2. Understand key columns (timestamp, location, variables)
#3. Filter by site + date window
#4. Make 3 core plots 
#5. Export plots

#start of lesson; following AO's instructions on Github in "ScottCreek_HistoricWaterQualityData"



###0. Install and load packages

#Load the lesson's necessary packages; for this lesson we will use tidyverse, lubridate, and janitor.

#A. you will need to install these packages first; to do so, write install.packages(c("insert package name here")
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "lubridate", "janitor"))

#8. Now call them in:
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(janitor)

#NOTE: you can skip step A in the future once you have installed the packages



##1. load in dataset

#We want to load in a single csv file named "WQ2015_clean.csv" (which is currently on my desktop in the "temp_data" folder and under "data")
#There are many ways to load in the data, for this lesson, we will use this command-
#      ChosenDataSetName <- read_csv("Your/File/Path/Is/Copmuter/Specific/YourFileName.csv")

#Let's name our dataset "WQ2015"
#On AO's computer, the filepath to her .csv is "/Users/alexia.olsen/Desktop/temp_data/data/output/WQ2015_clean.csv") 

# Following the template, mine might be "/Users/jasmine.moffett/Desktop/temp_data/data/output/WQ2015_clean.csv"; "output" was included bc it acts as a divider between your raw ingredients and finsihed product; it directs results to a /output/ folder so that /data/ file stays unchanged
# So, I will use the command-

WQ2015<-read_csv("/Users/jasmine.moffett/Desktop/temp_data/data/output/WQ2015_clean.csv")

#Check it read using glimpse
glimpse(WQ2015)




#Says my file path is wrong, need to fix before I can proceed so that R can read my data 
#Gemini is currently unable to help me
